# Data-Structures
This repository consist of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.<br>

The following ATDs have been implemented-<br>
<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Linked List</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>Binary Trees</li>
<li>Graphs</li>
<li>Heaps</li>
<li>Bags</li>
</ul>

For most of the ADTs there is a file '*Test.java' that tests all the functions of the class.<br>
Although the problems have not been commented, but I would be doing that soon.
